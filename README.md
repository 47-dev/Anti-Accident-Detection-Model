### Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based system that can detect potential vehicle accidents by monitoring the driver's eyes, face, and head gesture movements in real-time. The system will be capable of identifying signs of driver drowsiness, distraction, and other dangerous behaviors that can lead to accidents.

### Methodology:
The project will use a combination of computer vision techniques, deep learning algorithms, and sensor data to capture the driver's behavior. The system will track the driver's eye movements using a camera mounted on the dashboard, facial expressions using facial recognition software, and head gesture movements using a gyroscopic sensor.The machine learning algorithm will be trained using a dataset of driving scenarios to identify different patterns of driver behavior that may lead to accidents. The system will then use real-time data to identify if the driver is exhibiting any dangerous behavior and send an alert to the driver to correct the behavior.

### Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate anti-vehicle accident detection system that can help prevent accidents caused by driver drowsiness, distraction, and other dangerous behaviors. The system will help improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents on the roads.

### Potential Impact:
The potential impact of this project is significant as it can help prevent accidents caused by driver drowsiness, distraction, and other dangerous behaviors. It will also help reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads, making driving safer for everyone. The project can be used by car manufacturers, transportation companies, and individuals who want to improve road safety.
